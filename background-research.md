# Case study: Crop insurance in India

In 2018-19 and 2019-20, the gross premium amounted to Rs 17,220 crore and Rs 19,966 crore respectively. Against this, the reported claims were Rs 29,341 crore and Rs 27,394 crore, meaning a cumulative loss of Rs 19,549 crore. “The insurance industry is at an 80-85 per cent loss ratio currently

### PMFBY:
The cropped area under insurance was 26 per cent in 2018-19 compared to the government of India’s target to bring 50 per cent of the area cropped under insurance. This is despite an overhaul of crop insurance schemes by the Narendra Modi government in 2016 when it introduced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) as well as revisions to the existing schemes such as Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) and another revamping last year of both the schemes.

## Problem:
The key question is this – even if we make farmers aware of crop insurance and convince them that there is a need for insurance, does it make sense for them to buy crop insurance or would they still remain uninterested?

Buying any insurance – crop, health, accident – is rational on the part of the purchaser if an insurance claim is processed and settled on time. There is little incentive to take out insurance cover if many claims get rejected. What does the data show in terms of claim settlement for crop insurance?


## How Insurance works right now?

Until last year, for all farmers who took loans on their Kisan Credit Cards, the insurance premium amount was deducted mandatorily from their loan amounts. Some farmers insure their crops separately and not as a part of taking agricultural credit. Among such farmers who insured additionally, during the second half of 2018, depending on the crop, between 70 and 100 per cent of farmers who made an insurance claim for crop losses did not receive the compensation (Figure 3). The best-case scenario was of Bajra farmers, 42 per cent of whom received the insurance they claimed.

If farmers suffer the loss and do not receive insurance compensation, it is a waste of premium payment. During good farming years, there isn’t a need for a claim and during a bad year, the claim is not settled. Even under mandatory PMFBY, while the percentage of claim settlement is higher, the delays in payment have been significant. Recognising the delays in settling the claims and non-payment, the government of India made PMFBY voluntary from 2020 even for farmers who take crop loans from formal institutions.


## Why is it not working?
What are the reasons for such dismally low insurance claim settlement? The crop insurance claims are not rejected because they fall outside the coverage of the scheme or documents are lost by farmers. Almost all claims are rejected because of ‘other’ reasons. The other reasons relate to how the crop insurance schemes are structured, funded and implemented.

In recent years under PMFBY, there have been delays on the part of the state governments to pay their share of the premium subsidy.  Under the scheme, the central and state governments provide subsidies on insurance premiums, which the governments pay to the insurance company. It was then decided that the states that delayed the release of premium subsidies to concerned insurance companies beyond a prescribed time limit, would not be allowed to implement the scheme in subsequent seasons. In fact, states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Bihar left the scheme, citing the high cost of the premium subsidy, defeating the objective of raising the farm insurance cover.

Another reason is the delay of payments in the settlement of claims by insurance companies. To curb that, the government of India instituted a penalty interest of 12 per cent on insurance companies if they delayed settlement of claims beyond ten 10 days of the prescribed cut-off date. Among other reasons for rejections/delays in claim settlement include the delays in assessing the yield and disputes between the insurance companies and state governments over the yield data.
